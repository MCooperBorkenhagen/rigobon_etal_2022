## Figure 1: scatterplot of incorrect spellings to target ("assiduous")
This is Figure 1 in the paper. Here the points (labels) are jittered to minimize overlapping. The jittering (called within the `position` argument in `geom_label()`) introduces randomness into rendering the plot. In order to find the just right figure for the publication, the plot needs to be rendered until a satisfactory jittering is found. Without this visual manipulation of the data, misspelled forms overlap at each level of x- and y- such that you can only see one word, with the rest plotted behind it (which of course is undesirable because we want to see all the words in the figure).

```{r figure1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=7, fig.cap='Here the points (labels) are jittered to minimize overlapping. The jittering introduces randomness into rendering the plot. The reason for this jittering is that without it the misspelled forms would overlap at each level of x- and y- such that you could only see one misspelling, and the rest would be plotted behind it. The left panels show misspellings where the participant rated the target as familiar, and the right panels show those corresponding to unfamiliar ratings for the target. Target words were chosen because they exhibited variability in the familiarity rating across participants, where “assiduous” was only familiar to 11 participants and “kaleidoscope” was reported as being familiar to 48 participants. The origin of each plot represents the target itself, such that the distance of a given misspelling from the origin can be interpreted as the extent to which that misspelling is dissimilar from the target word either with respect to its orthographic structure (x-axis) or phonological structure (y-axis). Word labels (points) are colored based on the number of particular misspellings observed across participants. Dashed diagonals are included as a reference.'}

If I get the original "spell_schwa_project_long_2020_corrected22.xlsx" dataset, I can replicate Figure 2 here. Otherwise, here's the rendered image from the proof.

## Extras
### Figure 1 but with facets of set for variability (instead of familiarity)
Figure 1 in the paper shows the estimated representational distance (orthography and phonology) for misspellings for "assiduous" and "kaleidoscope" as a function of the familiarity of the word (left versus rght panel) for the participant providing the mis/spelling. Alternatively in the figure below the panels are the set for variability response for that 


```{r}
e %>% 
  select(participant_ID, target_word, item_sfv) %>% 
  filter(participant_ID == 25) %>%  View()
```


```{r}

e %>%
  mutate(target_word = case_when(target_word == 'assiduous' ~ 'TARGET: "Assiduous"',
                                 target_word == 'kaleidoscope' ~ 'TARGET: "Kaleidoscope"'),
         item_sfv = case_when(item_sfv == 1 ~ 'Correct',
                              item_sfv == 0 ~ 'Incorrect')) %>%

### Histogram 1: orthographic distance of incorrect spellings to target
This is visually depicted in the scatter version of the figure but shows the data in a way that is obscured slightly by the jitter. This one is for the orthographic distances (the x-axis), showing the histogram both for "assiduous" and "kaleidoscope". Specific misspellings within each level of x- are sorted from largest _n_ (at top of stack) to smallest (at bottom), where a larger vertical bar on the y-axis corresponds to more words with that particular misspelling.

```{r}


e %>% 
  group_by(target_word, participant_spelling) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            ODL = first(ODL)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(ODL, n, fill = reorder(participant_spelling, -n))) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -.5, y = -.85, xend = 5.5, yend = -.85), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.4, "cm")), lwd = .5) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  geom_text(aes(label=participant_spelling), size = 1.5,
            position = position_stack(vjust = .5),
            family = 'Times New Roman') +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = 'Times New Roman'), legend.position = 'none',
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14)) +
  labs(x = 'Orthographic distance from target (increasing)', y = 'Count') +
  facet_grid(~target_word)

```

### Histogram 2: phonological distance of incorrect spellings to target
This is the same idea as Histogram 1 above but showing phonological distance instead of orthographic distance.

```{r}


e %>% 
  group_by(target_word, participant_spelling) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            ODL_phon = first(ODL_phon)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(ODL_phon, n, fill = reorder(participant_spelling, -n))) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = -.5, y = -.85, xend = 5.5, yend = -.85), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.4, "cm")), lwd = .5) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +
  geom_text(aes(label=participant_spelling), size = 1.5,
            position = position_stack(vjust = .5),
            family = 'Times New Roman') +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = 'Times New Roman'), legend.position = 'none',
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14)) +
  labs(x = 'Phonological distance from target (increasing)', y = 'Count') +
  facet_grid(~target_word)


```
